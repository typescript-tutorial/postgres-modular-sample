# postgres-modular-sample

A simple modular RESTful microservice built with [**Express**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg), and the [**core-ts**](https://github.com/core-ts) ecosystem.

This project demonstrates how to build a clean, lightweight, and maintainable SQL-based microservice without using heavy frameworks, decorators, or dependency injection containers. It showcases explicit dependency composition, generic repositories, reusable CRUD use cases, request validation, and structured logging.

Unlike the more opinionated samples, this project keeps the request-processing flow explicit, making it an excellent starting point for learning how the Core TS libraries work together.

# Architecture

![Architecture](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JDYTlK00yg0IlUjZ9-sp7Q.png)

Business logic is independent of the PostgreSQL driver. Repositories depend on the generic `DB` abstraction provided by [**sql-core**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sql-core).

# Project Structure

```text
src
│
├── app.ts                 # Application bootstrap
├── config.ts              # Application configuration
├── context.ts             # Dependency composition
├── route.ts               # Route registration

│
└── user/
    ├── user.ts
    ├── repository.ts
    ├── service.ts
    ├── controller.ts
    └── index.ts
```

Each business feature is organized into its own module, making the project easy to extend and maintain.

---

# Layered Architecture

## Controller

Controllers are responsible for:

- Receiving HTTP requests
- Parsing request parameters
- Validating input
- Calling business services
- Returning HTTP responses

Business logic remains inside the use case layer.

---

## Service

The service layer contains application business logic.

Most CRUD functionality is inherited from reusable generic implementations provided by **onecore**, allowing services to stay small and focused.

```ts
export class UserUseCase
    extends UseCase<User, string, UserFilter> implements UserService
```

---

## Repository

The repository implementation is remarkably concise:

```ts
export class SqlUserRepository
    extends Repository<User, string, UserFilter>
```

Each repository extends reusable SQL repository implementations provided by [**sql-core**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sql-core), requiring only:

- Database connection
- Table name
- Entity model

Everything else is inherited from [**sql-core**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sql-core).

Custom queries can easily be added when needed.

This greatly reduces boilerplate while keeping the repository extensible for custom queries.

---

## Model

Models define:

- Entity structure
- Validation rules
- Metadata

Validation rules are centralized using [**validation-core**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validation-core), keeping controllers concise and consistent.

---

# Dependency Composition

Dependencies are wired explicitly rather than using a dependency injection framework.

```text
PostgreSQL
    │
    ▼
Repository
    │
    ▼
 Service
    │
    ▼
Controller
```

All dependencies are created in `context.ts`, serving as the application's composition root.

---

# SQL Abstraction

One of the best aspects is the use of [`sql-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sql-core).

Instead of repositories depending directly on PostgreSQL APIs, they depend on the generic `DB` interface:

```ts
constructor(db: DB)
```

This means repositories are written against an abstraction rather than a specific database driver.

Benefits include:

- Database independence
- Reusable repositories
- Reduced infrastructure coupling
- Cleaner architecture
- Improved testability

---

# Request Processing Flow

Unlike more abstract samples, this project keeps the HTTP flow explicit.

```text
HTTP Request
      │
      ▼
 Controller
      │
      ▼
Parse Request
      │
      ▼
Validate Model
      │
      ▼
   Service
      │
      ▼
  Repository
      │
      ▼
  PostgreSQL
      │
      ▼
HTTP Response
```

This makes the project particularly useful for developers learning the Core TS ecosystem.

---

# Localization

Validation and application messages support multiple languages.

```ts
const resource = getResource(req)
```

The project supports:

- English
- Vietnamese

Localization resources are located under:

```text
src/resources/
```

Validation messages automatically use the selected language.

This is a nice feature that many samples omit.

New languages can be added without changing business logic.

---

# Validation

Validation is handled by [**validation-core**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validation-core), with rules defined in the model.

```ts
const resource = getResource(req)

const errors = validate<User>(user, userModel, resource)
```

Validation rules are defined alongside the entity model rather than inside controllers.

Examples include:

- Required fields
- Email validation
- Length constraints
- Pattern validation
- Primary key validation

Type validation is also integrated into routing through:

```ts
const checkUser = check(userModel)
```

and reinforced in controller methods. This shows both middleware-based and controller-level validation approaches.

---

# Logging

The application uses MiddlewareLogger from [middleware-logging](https://www.npmjs.com/package/middleware-logging) together with [logger-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/logger-core) for structured request logging. This provides a consistent logging strategy across the application.

The sample uses structured request logging through [**middleware-logging**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/middleware-logging).

Middleware logging is configurable:

- HTTP method
- Request URL
- Request
- Response
- Status code
- Response size
- Execution time

It also propagates:

- Request ID
- Correlation ID

which is useful in distributed systems.

Sensitive request and response data can be masked before logging.

---

# Health Check

The sample includes a health endpoint suitable for containerized deployments.

The endpoint checks:

- PostgreSQL connectivity

They can easily be extended to include additional infrastructure services.

Example response

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "details": {
    "sql": {
      "status": "UP"
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Configuration

Configuration is managed using [**config-plus**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config-plus), merging:

```text
          Default Configuration
                   │
                   ▼
Environment Configuration (SIT, UAT, PRD)
                   │
                   ▼
   Environment Variables (process.env)
                   │
                   ▼
          Final Configuration
```

Typical configuration includes:

- HTTP server
- PostgreSQL connection
- Logging
- Localization
- Application settings

Environment variables can override default values for different deployment environments.

---

# Adding a New Module

Each business module follows the same structure.

```text
customer/
    controller.ts
    service.ts
    repository.ts
    customer.ts
    index.ts
```

To add a new module:

1. Define the entity model.
2. Create the repository.
3. Create the use case.
4. Create the controller.
5. Register routes.
6. Add the controller to the application context.

This consistent approach keeps the application modular and easy to maintain.

# Ecosystem Integration

This sample demonstrates how several [**core-ts**](https://github.com/core-ts) libraries work together.

| Library                                                                  | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| [`express-web-kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-web-kit)       | Express utilities and REST helpers                    |
| [`middleware-logging`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/middleware-logging) | HTTP request and response logging                     |
| [`validation-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validation-core)       | High-performance validation library                   |
| [`onecore`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onecore)                       | Generic CRUD use cases and common abstractions        |
| [`sql-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sql-core)                     | Generic SQL repositories and data access abstractions |
| [`postgres-kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgres-kit)             | PostgreSQL adapter for sql-core                       |
| [`logger-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/logger-core)               | Structured logging                                    |

Each library focuses on a single responsibility.

That demonstrates the intended layering very well.
